# sproj_2024
## Overview
This project is a **DAW-like application for live looping**, designed to provide intuitive control over clip rearrangement and musical structure in real time. Unlike traditional DAWs, this application prioritizes flexibility in live performance, allowing musicians to manipulate loops dynamically.

Built entirely using the [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) framework, it leverages JUCE’s powerful audio engine and GUI capabilities

## Features
✅ add features

## Building instructions

Since I'm using cmake for my build system, you can create IDE specific project files for development, here's an example of how you would do that for Xcode.

first you will need to copy the repository into a local folder, then call

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake -G Xcode ..`

this will create a project file for Xcode. (make sure you have Cmake version 3.22 or above)

## TO DO:

GUI:
  Tile grouping coloring working dynamically
